#### I'm Giovanni, a third year Ph.D. student in Economics at New York University.
------
My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, focusing in particular on what use people make of information and attention when these resources are scarce or otherwise limited. I like to think through these issues using the tools of empirical Industrial Organization. I also exploit experimental investigations in the lab when testing theories in the field is not feasible.

You can find my curriculum vitæ in the Vitæ section, while the projects I'm working on are listed in the Research section. I've reported the classes I taught or have been a TA for in the Teaching section.
