## Bio
I am currently based in New York City, pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at New York University. Previously, I've obtained a M.Sc. in Economics from Università Bocconi in Milan and a B.Sc. from Università Ca' Foscari in Venice (Italy). I was lucky enough to live for a couple of years on the beautiful island of San Servolo in Venice and spend one year in the UK as an Erasmus exchange student.
