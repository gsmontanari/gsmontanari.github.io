### Bio
---
I am currently based in New York City (USA), working as an Associate Ph.D. Economist at Cornerstone Research. I hold a Ph.D. and M.Phil. in Economics from New York University. Previously, I've obtained a M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences from Università Bocconi in Milan (Italy) and a B.Sc. in Economics and Business from Università Ca' Foscari in Venice (Italy).  


During my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to interact with and learn from several superb economists and researchers. I am especially grateful for the advising and collaborations with Professors H. Allcott, A. Caplin, A. Galichon, and D. Waldinger. I have had the opportunity to live most of the Ph.D. years in New York and Princeton, with a summer stint in Seattle for an internship at Amazon.

During my M.Sc., I lived in Milan and worked for Professors M. Ottaviani and N. Gennaioli on several projects in behavioral economics and economic theory. I was advised in my dissertation by Professor S. Nunnari.  

During my B.Sc., I was part of Ca' Foscari International College, a multidisciplinary honors school that allowed me to live for a couple of years on the beautiful island of San Servolo  together with a group of students enrolled in different degress (languagues, philosophy, art history, ...). I spent one summer attending the Ca' Foscari - Harvard Summer School in Economics and  one year in the United Kingdom as an Erasmus exchange student at the University of Warwick. I was advised in my dissertation by Professor M. LiCalzi.

My economics-unrelated interests include photography, art history, political philosophy and cooking.
