### Bio
---
I am currently based in New York City, pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at New York University. Previously, I've obtained a M.Sc. in Economic and Social Sciences from Università Bocconi in Milan (Italy) and a B.Sc. in Economics and Business from Università Ca' Foscari in Venice (Italy). 

During my B.Sc., I was part of Ca' Foscari International College, a multidisciplinary honors school that allowed me to live for a couple of years on the beautiful island of San Servolo  together with a group of students in different degress (languagues, philosophy, art history, ...). I spent one summer attending the Ca' Foscari - Harvard Summer School in Economics and  one year in the United Kingdom as an Erasmus exchange student at University of Warwick. I was advised in my dissertation by Professor Marco LiCalzi.

During my M.Sc., I lived in Milan and worked for Professors Marco Ottaviani and Nicola Gennaioli on several projects in behavioral economics and economic theory. I was advised in my dissertation by Professor Salvatore Nunnari.

My economics-unrelated interests include photography, art history, classical literature, political philosophy and cooking.
