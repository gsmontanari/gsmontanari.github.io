              The growing discussions of impact investing and stakeholder capitalism have increased interest in measuring companies' social impact, not just their profits. We conceptualize corporate social impact as the social welfare loss that would be caused by a firm's exit in equilibrium. We then quantify the social impacts of 73 large firms in 12 industries. We field a new survey measuring people's willingness to substitute away from the firms they buy from and work for. We use the survey data to estimate product market and labor market models and simulate counterfactual equilibria after a firm's exit. A key result is that consumer surplus is the most important component of firms' social impact, dwarfing profits (because they overwhelmingly accrue to wealthy people with low social marginal welfare weights), worker surplus, and externalities. Existing impact rating systems have little correlation with our economics-based metric.

              This paper presents a model of selective exposure to information and an experiment to test its predictions. An agent interested in learning about an uncertain state of the world can acquire information from one of two sources which have opposite biases: when informed on the state, they report it truthfully; when uninformed, they report their favorite state. When sources have the same reliability, a Bayesian agent is better off seeking confirmatory information. On the other hand, it is optimal to seek contradictory information if and only if the source biased against the prior is sufficiently more reliable. We test these predictions with an online experiment. When sources are symmetrically reliable, subjects are more likely to seek confirmatory information but they listen to the other side too frequently. When sources are asymmetrically reliable, subjects are more likely to consult the more reliable source even when prior beliefs are strongly unbalanced and listening to the less reliable source is more informative. Moreover, subjects follow contradictory advice sub-optimally; are too trusting of information in line with a source bias; and too skeptic of information misaligned with a source bias. Our experiment suggests that biases in information processing and simple heuristics — e.g., listen to the more reliable source — are important drivers of the endogenous acquisition of information.
